## Summary
The `GameStatisticsSmokeTest` class is a test fixture that contains a set of test methods for testing the functionality of a game statistics API. It uses the NUnit testing framework and the FluentAssertions library for assertions. The class includes methods for checking the availability of the API, retrieving game data, posting new game data, updating game data, and deleting game data.

## Example Usage
```csharp
// Set up the test fixture
var smokeTest = new GameStatisticsSmokeTest();
smokeTest.Setup();

// Check the availability of the API
await smokeTest.CheckApiAvailability();

// Get game data and assert that it returns OK
await smokeTest.GetGameData_ShouldReturnOkUnderMinimalLoadAsync();

// Get game data by ID and assert that it returns OK
await smokeTest.GetValidGameDataByID_ShouldReturnOkUnderMinimalLoadAsync();

// Post new game data and assert that it returns Created
await smokeTest.PostValidGameData_ShouldReturnCreatedUnderMinimalLoadAsync();

// Update game data and assert that it returns NoContent
await smokeTest.PutValidGameData_ShouldReturnNoContentUnderMinimalLoadAsync();

// Delete game data by ID and assert that it returns NotFound
await smokeTest.DeleteUnvalidGameDataByID_ShouldReturnNotFoundUnderMinimalLoadAsync();

// Tear down the test fixture
smokeTest.TearDown();
```

## Code Analysis
### Main functionalities
- Check the availability of the API
- Retrieve game data and assert that it returns OK
- Retrieve game data by ID and assert that it returns OK
- Post new game data and assert that it returns Created
- Update game data and assert that it returns NoContent
- Delete game data by ID and assert that it returns NotFound
___
### Methods
- `Setup()`: Initializes the HTTP client with the base URL of the API and the number of times the API will be called.
- `CheckApiAvailability()`: Sends a GET request to the `/gamedata` endpoint of the API and asserts that the response status code is OK.
- `TearDown()`: Disposes of the HTTP client resources.
- `GetGameData_ShouldReturnOkUnderMinimalLoadAsync()`: Sends multiple GET requests to the `/gamedata` endpoint in parallel and asserts that each response status code is OK and the response content is valid JSON.
- `GetValidGameDataByID_ShouldReturnOkUnderMinimalLoadAsync()`: Sends multiple GET requests to the `/gamedata/{ID}` endpoint with random valid IDs in parallel and asserts that each response status code is OK and the response content is valid JSON.
- `PostValidGameData_ShouldReturnCreatedUnderMinimalLoadAsync()`: Sends multiple POST requests to the `/gamedata` endpoint with random valid game data in parallel and asserts that each response status code is Created and the response content is valid JSON.
- `PutValidGameData_ShouldReturnNoContentUnderMinimalLoadAsync()`: Sends multiple PUT requests to the `/gamedata/{ID}` endpoint with random valid game data in parallel and asserts that each response status code is NoContent.
- `DeleteUnvalidGameDataByID_ShouldReturnNotFoundUnderMinimalLoadAsync()`: Sends multiple DELETE requests to the `/gamedata/{ID}` endpoint with random invalid IDs in parallel and asserts that each response status code is NotFound.
___
### Fields
- `_client`: An instance of the `HttpClient` class used to send HTTP requests to the API.
- `_times`: The number of times the API will be called during the tests.
___
### Models
#### GameData
The `GameData` class is a model class that represents the data structure for game statistics. It contains properties for the game ID, game name, category, and total bets.

#### Example Usage
```csharp
GameData gameData = new GameData();
gameData.Id = "123";
gameData.GameName = "Chess";
gameData.Category = "Board Game";
gameData.TotalBets = 1000;
```

#### Code Analysis
##### Main functionalities
The main functionality of the `GameData` class is to store and provide access to game statistics data. It allows setting and retrieving values for the game ID, game name, category, and total bets.
___
##### Methods
The `GameData` class does not have any methods.
___
##### Fields
- `Id`: Represents the unique identifier of the game.
- `GameName`: Represents the name of the game.
- `Category`: Represents the category of the game.
- `TotalBets`: Represents the total number of bets made on the game.
